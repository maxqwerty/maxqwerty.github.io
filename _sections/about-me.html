<p>I am a <strong>Desktop Developer</strong>, using <strong>Qt/C++</strong> as main tool and <strong>Ruby/Python</strong> as auxiliary tools. I started as web-developer and has some skills in <em>Front-end</em> but more in <em>Back-end</em>. I’d like to try all the kinds of possibilities a programmer can have in our <strong>Century of Explosive Progress of Computer Science</strong>. Only <em>Mobile Development</em> still wasn’t been touched (except for a little experience in Android development with Qt). Some of my pet projects suggests to be placed in mobile platforms therefore I am planning to work with this knowledge gap in the near future.</p>
