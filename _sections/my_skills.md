### C++
Most used in my professional needs. Sometime complicated but great tool in the right hands
* #### Qt - great framework with a difficult past but great present
  * MVC pattern realized in Qt
  * *QThread*, *QPainter*, *QtNetwork* and others cross-platform wrappers
  * CSS-styling, custon element styling with QStyle
  * UI-designer
  * *QTQuick* - my favorite part of the framework!

* #### OpenCV
  * I am just a newbie at this

### Ruby
I like this language more than Python and any other object-orianted laguage for a great realization of object-orientation.
* #### Native
  * Eigenclass
  * method_missing
  * `def my_method(arg, *arr, **kw, &block)`
  * Rakefile

* #### Active Record
The best ORM I ever seen. I use it even in the web-less scripts.

* #### Sinatra
For simple web-apps

* #### Rails
I wish I have more time to play with it! But it is developing faster than I can try all the features. May be someday... When I get tired of *Desktop Development* I will become a backend-developer to use this framework.

Neural-Network-oriented PyTorch, Kears and Tensorflow are in the plans.
